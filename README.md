Config.php is empty for security reasons

You may run the test at http://willysites.com/dreamworld/index.php

I put an additional way to get a list of the existent emails http://willysites.com/dreamworld/index.php?op=list

To create the table and generate the test accounts you want to use create.php but because this is a cpanel web hosting there is no way to run it. I ran it locally in my computer.

Thanks for the oportunity to apply for this position.
